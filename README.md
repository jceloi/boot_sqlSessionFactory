Initial conditions :
=====
* Maven 3.3.3
* JDK 1.8


Test procedure :
=====
**From project root & initial state (fresh from github)**

 
1. mvn clean install (required as there are inter-modules dependencies)
2. mvn -f ./TestApiWar/pom.xml spring-boot:run


**Expected :**

Should boot properly. No error and http://localhost:8090/health down because the postgresql database is configured with crappy values... but the server is up and running.


Action :
-----


1. Modify TestApiWar/pom.xml -> Uncomment the spring security and spring security oauth2 dependencies    
2. mvn clean install (required as there are inter-modules dependencies)
3. mvn -f ./TestApiWar/pom.xml spring-boot:run


**Expected :**

Eventually boots, but with quite a lot of warnings and looping..

On this small project it does eventually boot, but on my big app is loops infinitely.
